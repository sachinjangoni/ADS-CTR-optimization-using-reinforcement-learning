# About dataset
Ten different types of car(SUV) advertisments in different locations.the datasent as 0 and 1 variables suppose if the user click on Ad1 then machine get reward of 1 otherwise it gets 0.
# Task
We have to identify which add got so many clicks from the user to increase car sells by posting that advertisement in the market for that we can propose best Reinforcement learning model to increase companies revenue.
Implemented two powerful Reinforcement learning algoritms to achieve goal.
# Thompson Sampling
# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
# Evaluation
Thompson Sampling is better compare with UCB because its very quick and fast and also its generating accurate results when we decrease the total no of instances.if company wants to increase their car sales better to go with Thompson Sampling.
